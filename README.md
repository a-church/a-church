### Hello.
I'm A.C. and this is where I store code for people to look at. I used to use pastebin, but it became a bit of a hassle. \
I am a 2026 grad @ Stuart Hall School in Virginia. \
I prefer they/them pronouns, but pronouns aren't incredibly important to me. \
I would not like to be contacted as of now, but this will likely change once I become more confident in my work.
